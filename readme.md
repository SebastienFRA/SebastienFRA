## About me  üë®üèª
Hi, i'm S√©bastien, the french "developper" behind LVASI. I have no real coding knowledge. I learn little by little when I need to improve LVASI.  
I created LVASI more by challenge than by necessity, and as I like to share what I do, it's here!  
  
## What can you do to help us ? ü§ù  
You can submit software to add to LVASI.  
To help LVASI to develop, you can share it with your entourage, on your social networks...  
You can also give your opinion on the sites where LVASI is available ([Softpedia](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/Download-Managers/L-V-A-S-I.shtml), [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lvasi/), [AlternativeTo](https://alternativeto.net/software/lvasi/about/)).  
If you are a graphic designer or if you know one, LVASI would need a new more personal icon üòâ.
